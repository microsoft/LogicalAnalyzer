# Object Analysis Toolkit

Object Analysis Toolkit (OAT) is a rules processing engine to apply provided rules against arbitrary objects.

* [Rules](https://github.com/microsoft/OAT/blob/main/OAT/Rule.cs) contain a Target, a Severity, a boolean Expression and a List of [Clauses](https://github.com/microsoft/OAT/blob/main/OAT/Clause.cs) which are applied to the targeted object.
* [Clauses](https://github.com/microsoft/OAT/blob/main/OAT/Clause.cs) perform a specified [Operation](https://github.com/microsoft/OAT/blob/main/OAT/Operation.cs) on a specified Field of a Target.  The Field can be any property or subproperty or field of the object specified with dot notation to separate levels. 
* The Analyzer has 4 delegate extensibility points.
1. Property Parsing
2. Value Extraction
3. Custom Operation
4. Rule Validation

Check the [Wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/OAT/wiki) for additional detail.

## Basic Usage

The basic usage of Logical Analyzer is applying rules to targets using the Analyze function.

```csharp
object target;
IEnumerable<Rule> rules;
var analyzer = new Analyzer();
var rulesWhichApply = analyzer.Analyze(rules,target);
```
## Authoring Rules

Detailed information on how to author rules is available on on the [wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/OAT/wiki/Authoring-Rules).

## Detailed Usage

A full walkthrough is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/OAT/wiki/Walkthrough).

## Delegates

Documentation for implementing each delegate is available in the [wiki](https://github.com/microsoft/OAT/wiki/Delegates).
